## Naming Convetions:
Allting ska ha ett namn.

## What are we making:
A real-time top-down rouge-like dungeon crawler suitet for Drifvarkaden in META. 

## MVP:
- A map / level to play (preferably procedurally generated).
  - Walls
- An avatar through which the player can interact with the world
  - Cause damage
  - Take damage
  - Collide with obstacles
  - Move
- Enemies that pose some challange to the player.
  - Cause damage
  - Take damage
  - Collide with obstacles
  - Move
  - AI
- A way to accumulate score to be saved and later shown. (Arcade games need scorebaord)
- 2d graphics.

## MVP +/++
- 2 player mode
- Cool visual effects
- Lore
- Pickups
- 9 bosses
- Dialouge
- NPCs
- Shop

## Feasibility:
It isn't hard to complete the **MVP** if we do not consider quality. However, if we take a look at **MVP +/++** then I can imagine it quickly becoming unreasonable.

## Division of work:
Look at our [project](https://github.com/orgs/IndaPlus24/projects/5/views/1).
